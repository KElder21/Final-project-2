# Final Project

This has been a strange and very long year. But if you had told me I would be building a site for myself, I probably would not have believed you. But, here we are.

## Materials Included

Here I have included two deliverables from other assignments: my markdown file discussing accessibility in websites, and a pdf of my structured authoring assignments. 

## Final thoughts for this semester

I wasn't sure where I would end up when I began this semester, but if I can sum it up in a platitude, it would be, "A journey of one thousand miles begins with a single step." I sometimes feel overwhelmed with the amount of information and options there are available, and I feel that I must learn them all at once. I have to keep reminding myself that I don't have to learn everything now, and it's ok to just start without an end in mind. Rather like how I'm pursuing this degree.
