# My New Digital Literacy Narrative
A long, long, time ago, in a living room far, far, away...

## Humble Beginnings
...there lived a beige box with a separate hard drive that still lives in my memory. It was my first foray into technology. It was eventually followed by a colorful, oddly shaped plastic computer with a circular mouse. The Oregon Trail, The Amazon Trail, Arthur, and Candy Land all featured heavily. And I wrote on that computer all the way through high school, mostly doing word processing and basic internet stuff. Cute as it was, it didn't do well with images or rendering. 

## Lo! An Amateur Approacheth!
So I got my laptop for college, and learned how to reset the hard drive to a previous point after a misfortunate click. And then I upgraded after 6 years, a battery replacement, a charging port replacement, and a few sticky keys to a gorgeous touchscreen laptop that wouldn't die within an hour of taking it off the charging port. And still, looking back now, I didn't know what those machines were actually capable of. I'm nowhere near an expert now, of course; I'm probably at the far left side of the Dunning-Kruger graph. I'm just about to start that slide into "oh my goodness, I had no idea of how much I didn't know." 

## Reflections
This semester has been a learning experience in several ways: I did it during a global pandemic, I learned to work with people in several digitals mediums while juggling responsibilities, and I built a site that looks somewhat good. It's been hard but pretty rewarding to see the results pop up almost instantly.

## The List, Because I Should Probably Have One
1. There will always be more to learn, but you can always start small.
2. Even a little is better than nothing. 
3. Just start, even if you don't know where you'll end up.
4. Reach out for help.
5. I am incredibly privileged to be learning in this medium, in this time, in this country. I have abled eyes, fingers, vocal cords. I need to remember that I am not the sum total of my audience. 
6. There's a digital medium that's likely to fit you. It's probably not straight up html unless you're very anal retentive.
